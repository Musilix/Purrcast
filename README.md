## What is Purrcast?
Purrcast was built with the intention of testing the viability of the old folk tale that says if you're cat is sleeping on their head, you can expect the chances of rain to increase.

## Why Purrcast?
As a kid I noticed the trend of it always raining whenever my cats were laying on their head, but it could have just been selection bias at work. So now Purrcast is here to provide way too many resources, time, sweat, blood, and gruel to figure out if that old folk tale had any truth to it.

## What's the Status of Purrcast?
Purrcast is currently still being developed, so many features and pieces of the UI will probably seem janky. Slowly those'll come around!
